## Introduction

 <br>
 A straight line can be defined as the shortest distance between two points. The projection of these two points translates on to lines as well.
<br>
The position of a straight line is described with respect to the two reference planes. It may be:
<br>
1. Parallel to one or both the planes, as shown in Fig. 1.
