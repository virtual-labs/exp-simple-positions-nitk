      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct, the right answer is (a). The top view of the line will be a point if the line is parallel to VP and perpendicular to HP because the front view projects the projections of VP and the top view projects the projection of HP.",
        "b": "The right answer is (a). If the line is parallel to HP and perpendicular to VP, then the top view is a straight line.",
        "c": "The right answer is (a). If the line is inclined to HP and VP, then the top view will be a straight line inclined to both VP and HP.",

        "a": "The right answer is (c). If the line is perpendicular to HP, then the line is projected as a line that appears on VP.",

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "The right answer is (b). A line can have either front view or top view as a point but not both of them. Because the HP and VP are perpendicular to each other.",
